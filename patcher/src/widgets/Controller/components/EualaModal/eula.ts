<p class="p0 ft0">[One Paragraph]</p>
<p class="p1 ft0">CAMELOT UNCHAINED™ END USER ACCESS AND LICENSE AGREEMENT (EUALA)</p>
<p class="p2 ft0">SUMMARY</p>
<p class="p3 ft1">The EUALA is the legally binding contract that governs the relationship between You and CSE. You must agree to it in order to access our servers (the “System”) and play the Game. The current version of it is always available at</p>
<p class="p4 ft1">[insert link to EUALA]. The entire EUALA is important, but the stuff you really need to know (and be reminded of on a regular basis) is:</p>
<p class="p5 ft1"><span class="ft1">1)</span><span class="ft2">You must be an adult in order to play the game, or your parents or legal guardians must agree to this EUALA in order for you to access the System;</span></p>
<p class="p6 ft1"><span class="ft1">2)</span><span class="ft2">You need an account to access the System, and it is yours alone. You may not sell, rent, or lend it to others. You are solely responsible for it and for your passwords (keep them safe);</span></p>
<p class="p7 ft1"><span class="ft1">3)</span><span class="ft2">CSE owns all the software and all the data produced within the Game. You are only getting a limited license to use the software and play the Game. We have the right to decide who gets access and who doesn’t. We like you, we really do, but don’t try and mess with us or our stuff, or we reserve the right to suspend, delete, or descend a flock of ducks on your Account. Violate this Agreement, and don’t be surprised if your access is terminated.</span></p>
<p class="p8 ft1"><span class="ft1">4)</span><span class="ft2">The System and Game may be accessed for entertainment purposes only (this is our business, not yours so prospective gold farmers, get the hell out now!);</span></p>
<p class="p9 ft1"><span class="ft1">5)</span><span class="ft2">You can’t do anything that messes with the System or Game play such as using bots or trying to disrupt the System. In fact, it’s illegal;</span></p>
<p class="p10 ft1"><span class="ft1">6)</span><span class="ft2">The Founder’s Items and Founder’s Points you have purchased have no value outside the game, and may not be sold to third parties. No refunds for these items if you lose permanent access to the System and Game for whatever reason;</span></p>
<p class="p11 ft1"><span class="ft1">7)</span><span class="ft2">Abide by the Code of Conduct. Play fair, be kind, and beat the snot out of each other inside the game;</span></p>
<p class="p12 ft1"><span class="ft1">8)</span><span class="ft2">This is an Alpha build of the game. It WILL have bugs; we WILL have to shut it down for days or even weeks at a time; we will wipe characters early and often. Don’t be upset when we reset stats or delete items, or the System crashes and you lose things. We’re all test pilots here, so expect to crash and burn often;</span></p>
<p class="p13 ft1"><span class="ft1">9)</span><span class="ft2">As part of the Alpha testers, you are bound to a strict duty of nondisclosure of what you see and do within the game. No blabbing about it to others. Feel free to talk about it on our Alpha forums, that’s why we created them, just for you;</span></p>
<p class="p14 ft1"><span class="ft1">10)</span><span class="ft3">You are now in Alpha 1. This is also known as a Tech Alpha. It is less game and more really good engine working its way up to great. More and more fun stuff will be added as we work our way through Alpha but it’s more important for us to have a great foundation then try to build a great penthouse but the foundation is rotten; and</span></p>
<p class="p11 ft1"><span class="ft1">11)</span><span class="ft3">Have fun, be creative but remember, this is only a game and this is only an Alpha test.</span></p>
